# Python Scripts for Notepad++ Python Script Plugin  
  
Welcome to the repository for Python scripts designed to enhance your Notepad++ experience using the Python Script plugin. This collection of scripts aims to automate various tasks, improve coding productivity, and introduce new functionalities directly within your favorite text editor.  
  
## Features  
  
- **Automation Tools**: Scripts for automating repetitive tasks, such as formatting code, inserting boilerplate text, or managing file metadata.  
- **Productivity Boosters**: Enhancements to increase your coding speed and accuracy, including snippets, quick actions, and code analysis tools.  
- **Custom Functionality**: Scripts that add unique functionalities to Notepad++, tailored to your specific needs or preferences.  
  
## How to Use  
  
1. **Install the Python Script Plugin**: Ensure you have the [Python Script plugin](https://github.com/bruderstein/nppythonscript) installed in Notepad++.  
  
2. **Clone this Repository**: Clone or download this repository to a location on your computer.  
  
3. **Import Scripts**:  
   - Open Notepad++.  
   - Navigate to the `Plugins` menu and select `Plugins Admin...`.  
   - Ensure the `Python Script` plugin is installed and enabled.  
   - Open the Python Script console (`Plugins` > `Python Script` > `Show Console`).  
   - In the console, use the `import` command to load scripts from your local repository directory. For example:  
     ```python  
     import os  
     script_dir = r'C:\path\to\your\repository'  # Adjust the path to your scripts  
     for script in os.listdir(script_dir):  
         if script.endswith('.py'):  
             exec(open(os.path.join(script_dir, script)).read())  
     ```  
  
4. **Using Scripts**: Once imported, you can call the functions or classes defined in the scripts directly from the Python Script console or by assigning hotkeys within Notepad++.

README.md generated by 文心一言 with following:
我建了一个repo用来保存notepad++里面python script插件使用的脚本的。写一个英文的可以放在github上的README.md

注意：自动生成的README.md的安装部分有问题，安装脚本只需要直接clone repo到%USER_PROFILE%\Roaming\Notepad++\plugins\config\PythonScript\scripts下就可以了
